>“I have a strong vision and set list of goals I aim to achieve”

This is a complete list of all [Grit's](https://github.com/CodingWithAnxiety) personal goals as a staff member.

- **Open source my projects & templates**
	- My biggest objective as a staff member is to be *transparent* and *open* with my other team members and squadmates alike; and thus, my biggest objective is to make all the materials I use open source, excluding story elements, campaigns, or anything else that might spoil an overarching narrative.
- **Produce tools & templates to assist the workflow of others.**
	- I want to make toolchains & templates for other staff members to use, so that their jobs may become easier on a strong foundation.
- **Produce unique & well thought out plots**
	- I want each of the campaigns and stories I write to be unique & creative, whilst remaining well planned and prepared; allowing for teams to reproduce them and readapt them however they must.
- **Represent the overarching MSRT community**
	- I want to represent the professionalism and respect of the MSRT community and it's members, along with setting a foundational goal & example for other members to look up to
- **Grow as a member through trials and tribulations**
	- I want to not only learn from my own mistakes, but from the good things I do as well, and grow as a member inside of the MSRT community.
