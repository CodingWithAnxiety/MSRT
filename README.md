# Welcome to the MSRT GIT
The MSRT git is designed to Make Your Life Easierâ„¢ with resources & templates for creating documents, images, logos, and more. It is distributed using [The Unlicense](./LICENSE), which means you may use anything here for whatever reason in any way without credit. **Credit, however, is *always* appreciated.**

## Where do I start?
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the repository and understand where things are. As things are added to this repo, I will link things here.

This repo was created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a high quality markdown editor which I have used in my personal life for several years now. The plugins I use are listed in [Tools I Use](https://github.com/CodingWithAnxiety/MSRT/blob/main/Guides/Tools%20I%20Use.md).

This section will be updated when the repository is more full.
